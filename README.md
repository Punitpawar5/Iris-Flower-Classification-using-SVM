# Iris-Flower-Classification-using-SVM
SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks, but it's most commonly applied to classification.
1. Overview-

The goal of this project is to classify different types of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on the length and width of their petals and sepals. We will use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to achieve this.

2. Steps-

Load the Iris dataset.

Preprocess the data (if needed).

Train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

Evaluate the model with accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

Visualize the decision boundary (optional but interesting).

### Evaluation

Accuracy Score: Measures how many predictions were correct.

Classification Report: Includes precision, recall, F1-score for each class (flower species).

Confusion Matrix: Provides a visual representation of the classifier's performance in terms of true and false predictions.

Decision Boundary (Optional): We plot the decision boundary of the SVM using two features (petal length and petal width) for a 2D visualization.
